## 📚 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Features

The AIChatBot includes advanced RAG capabilities that allow AI models to answer questions based on your uploaded documents. This feature significantly enhances the AI's ability to provide contextually relevant and accurate responses.

### 🏗️ RAG Architecture

The RAG system consists of several key components:

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**:
   - File upload handling for multiple formats
   - Text extraction from PDF, TXT, and MD files
   - Content chunking for efficient retrieval
   - In-memory indexing with similarity search

2. **Retrieval System**:
   - Semantic search across document chunks
   - Top-K retrieval (configurable, default: 3 chunks)
   - Relevance scoring and ranking
   - Source attribution and metadata tracking

3. **Generation Enhancement**:
   - Context-aware prompt construction
   - Integration with all supported AI models
   - Source citation in responses
   - Fallback to general knowledge when needed

### 🎛️ RAG Configuration

The RAG system supports various AI models with different levels of effectiveness:

| Model Category | Models | RAG Performance |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Best RAG Support** | GPT-3.5 Turbo<br>Gemini Flash 2.0 (Unlimited)<br>Gemini Flash 2.0 (Limited) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Good RAG Support** | DeepSeek v3<br>Gemma 3 27B<br>LLaMA 3 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Basic RAG Support** | PHI-3<br>Mistral 7B | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### 🚀 Using RAG Features

1. **Upload Documents**:
   ```bash
   # Supported formats
   - Plain text files (.txt)
   - Markdown files (.md) 
   - PDF documents (.pdf)
   ```

2. **Document Management**:
   - View all uploaded documents
   - Delete individual documents
   - User-specific document collections
   - Automatic indexing upon upload

3. **RAG-Enhanced Chat**:
   - Select "Knowledge-Based (RAG)" mode
   - Ask questions about your uploaded content
   - Receive responses with source attribution
   - Contextual answers based on document content

### 💾 Document Storage

Currently, the RAG system uses in-memory storage (`InMemoryRagStore`), which provides:
- Fast retrieval performance
- Simple deployment setup
- Automatic cleanup on application restart
- User-isolated document collections

*Note: For production deployments, consider implementing persistent storage solutions.*

## 🧠 AI Tools & Agent Integration

The AIChatBot supports three advanced operation modes beyond simple chat:

### 1. 🛠️ Tool-Enabled AI
In this mode, the AI can recognize specific tasks in user prompts and use internal tools (functions) to perform actions. Integrated tools include:

| Tool Function    | Description                                  | Example Prompt                                                   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CreateFile`     | Creates a text file with given content       | "Create a file called `report.txt` with the text `Hello world`." |
| `FetchWebData`   | Fetches the HTML/content of a public URL     | "Fetch the content of https://example.com"                       |
| `SendEmail`      | Simulates sending an email (console-logged)  | "Send an email to john@example.com with subject `Hello`."        |

These functions are executed server-side in `.NET`, with input parsed from natural language prompts.

### 2. 📚 Knowledge-Based (RAG) Mode
**NEW FEATURE:** The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) mode enables AI to answer questions based on your uploaded documents. This powerful feature allows you to:

#### 🎯 Key Capabilities:
- **Upload Documents**: Support for `.txt`, `.md`, and `.pdf` files
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Automatically finds relevant content from your documents
- **Source Attribution**: AI responses include references to source documents
- **Document Management**: View, organize, and delete uploaded documents
- **User-Specific Storage**: Each user has their own document collection

#### 📄 Supported File Formats:
- **Text Files**: `.txt` - Plain text documents
- **Markdown Files**: `.md` - Formatted markdown documents  
- **PDF Documents**: `.pdf` - Portable document format

#### 🚀 How to Use RAG Mode:
1. **Upload Documents**: Use the drag-and-drop interface or browse to upload documents
2. **Select RAG Mode**: Choose "Knowledge-Based (RAG)" from the chat mode dropdown
3. **Ask Questions**: Query your documents using natural language
4. **Get Contextual Answers**: Receive AI responses enriched with your document content

#### 💡 Example RAG Interaction:
```
User: "What are the key findings in the latest market report?"
AI: Based on the provided context from "market_analysis_2025.pdf", the key findings include:
1. Consumer spending increased by 15% in Q4
2. Digital transformation investments rose by 23%
3. Supply chain disruptions decreased significantly

*Sources: 1 document(s) referenced*
```

### 3. 🤖 AI Agent Mode (Planning + Action)
The AI agent is capable of:
- Understanding high-level tasks
- Selecting and invoking appropriate tools
- Providing intelligent responses based on the outcome

This is powered by an `AgentService` that works with both **local LLMs** (via Ollama) and **cloud models** (via OpenRouter) to determine the right function to execute and handle the response.

You can toggle between AI modes via the UI:
- **Chat-Only Mode**
- **AI + Tools Mode**
- **Knowledge-Based (RAG) Mode**
- **Agent Mode** (multi-step planning, coming soon)
